This app does not take up much space.

This app was made by AlienGames. If you want,
you can tell you friends about this app.

I will be adding more and more functions so be sure to
keep up on checking in github.

To start this app type `ToDoList`

If you want information on updates, look in Changelog.md and 
the updates and what I have changed will be posted there.

To install type: 

```!/bin/bash

git clone https://github.com/Raspberry-Pi-Reviews/ToDoList.git

cd ToDoList/ToDoList/src/

sudo mv ToDoList.py /usr/local/bin
