This app does not take up much space.

This app was made by AlienGames. If you want,
you can tell you friends about this app.

I will be adding more and more functions so be sure to
keep up on checking in github.

To start this app, go to file manager, then go to "ToDoList". Next go to src, 
then double click on "Simple To-Do list", then press Execute in terminal.
there will be a youtube tutorial video.

If you want information on updates, look in Changelog.md and 
the updates and what I have changed will be posted there.
