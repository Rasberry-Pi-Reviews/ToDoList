This app does not take up much space.

I will be adding more and more functions so be sure to
keep up on checking in github.

To start this app type `ToDoList`

If you want information on updates, look in Changelog.md and 
the updates and what I have changed will be posted there.

To install type: 
`wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raspberry-Pi-Reviews/ToDoList/main/install | bash`
